# Vulnerabilidades
```
For all vulnerabilities:
Vulnerabilities should be distinct and have distinct CWEs;
The CWE must be identified;
The implementation must follow the logic and purpose of the application. That is, no page with the single purpose of showing the vulnerability;
Students should be able to demonstrate the vulnerability in a report with scripts/screenshots;
It is preferred to have vulnerabilities that result from bad patterns instead of those resulting from something that is missing. Avoid things like absence of brute force protection/access control/encryption/logging
```
